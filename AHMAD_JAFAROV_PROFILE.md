## About Me

Hey there! I'm Ahmad, a Software developer who's spent the last few years getting unreasonably invested in web and mobile development with React.

I'm lowkey obsessed with understanding how things work under the hood. It comes from a genuine curiosity to understand the background. In high school, I learned that grasping the intuition behind formulas (shoutout to [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)) made me significantly better at implementation. This foundational knowledge allows me to excel at solutions and ship projects much faster.

I really believe that I think differently when it comes to solving problems. I manage stress well and focus on dividing tasks effectively within the team. I always aim to follow best principles and never want to compromise on quality.

## Philosophy

### Approach to Problem Solving

Once I have a working solution, I care a lot about how it lives on. I always try to refactor and simplify the code so that my teammates (and my future self) can work with it easily, without needing to dig into the complexity I wrestled with.

For me, solving the problem is step one; making the solution maintainable is what actually counts.

### Learning Style

I tend to get consumed by the challenge until I figure it out. I'm not just looking for a quick fix - I want to understand the *why* behind it.

However, I'm realistic. I know I can't learn the backstage of everything. Sometimes I have to be satisfied with the abstraction, otherwise I'd never deliver a project considering what a rabbit hole the development ecosystem is.
